# ECO Reels: Raising Green Awareness Through Ecotourism in the US

## üìå Project Description

**ECO Reels** is a dynamic and flexible initiative that seeks to promote ecotourism in the United States‚Äîstarting in Colorado‚Äîby producing a series of short films that combine powerful narratives with artificial intelligence (AI) technology. These films highlight natural beauty, cultural diversity (including the legacy of Indigenous communities), and the importance of environmental conservation.

The project integrates the **"Your Green Footprint"** program, which turns tourists into active agents of environmental restoration through the symbolic planting of native species, contributing to CO‚ÇÇ capture and ecosystem recovery.
